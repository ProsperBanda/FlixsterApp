### Reflection

- Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

Yes, the labs helped me to build this project. The debugging tools learnt from the lab helped me catch some errors and manage to fix them. The stretch features were the ones I felt unprepared for.

- If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.

With more time I would have added more features including the stretch features and also use more styling for an improved user experience.

- Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

I managed to implement the required features, made the website responsive and grasped debugging skills. I noticed that my peer implemented stretch features like pop-up and hover. These I would like to try next time, challenging myself to got an extra mile and do the stretch features.

### Open-source libraries used

- Add any links to open-source libraries used in your project.

### Shout out

Give a shout out to somebody from your cohort that especially helped you during your project. This can be a fellow peer, instructor, TA, mentor, etc.
-Shout out to Diogo and Tim for clearly explaining concepts when I got stuck on the project.
